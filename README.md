Hangman
=======
This is a small project I started as general programming practice, and
especially practice for the OOP components of Python. The Guesser class
created takes a user given word and will attempt to determine that word
following standard hangman rules, losing after 6 wrong guesses. It is supplied
with a large dictionary of English words for consideration. The board is
printed to the terminal after every guess, and is a beautifully crafted ASCII
masterpiece.

Single words of a-z aplhabetic characters are the only workable inputs. Future
features should include arbitrary length multi-word phrases, and the current
architecture is close to supporting that already. Allowing a user to guess is
also implementable (probably) fairly easily.

The rules of PEP 8 are only a minor influence. The code will be unelegant, the
documentation either unclear or too redundant, and the solutions to what are
(to you) simple problems will be surprisingly verbose sand hackish. I'm sorry,
but at least I got this thing to do what I meant. May this be a history lesson
for both my future self and others.
